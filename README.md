# Tooloop OS

Tooloop OS is a minimal installation of [Debian](https://www.debian.org/), customized to fit the needs of public multimedia installations.

Tooloop OS is for media artists. It is supposed to provide a platform that is stable and easy to maintain even for those with little experience. Focus on your art!

**Tooloop OS is there for you**  to ensure your audience will only get to see your work. No balloon bubbles, no error messages, no unwanted updates, no blue screens.  
It is also very lightweight. It boots very fast and all the power of your machine is used to display your application and for nothing else.

All features on top of the base system are carefully chosen and configured to reflect this mission.

## Installation

The goal is to provide ISOs ready for you to install. In the early stage of this project however, focus is still on selection of the right packages and smart configuration.

So for now, follow the [manual steps](https://github.com/vollstock/Tooloop-OS/wiki/Manual-installation).


## Status

The project is in an early state. I'm still researching and defining all components and how the overall system should work. What features I would want from it and could use in the future.


## Roadmap

**0.9**  
Make the system ready

**1.0**  
Create a Simple-CDD package and a default ISO

Get Graphics card installation (including hardware accelerated video)
