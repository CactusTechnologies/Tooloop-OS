# Installation

The goal is to provide ISOs ready for you to install. In the early stage of this project however, focus is still on selection of the right packages and smart configuration.

So for now, please follow the [manual steps](https://github.com/vollstock/Tooloop-OS/wiki/Manual-installation).  

Even installing manually, however you can get your *Tooloop Box* up and running in about 30 minutes.

# Status

The project is in an early state. I'm still researching and defining all components and how the overall system should work. What features I would want from it and could use in the future.

Please check the [roadmap](https://github.com/vollstock/Tooloop-OS/wiki/roadmap) for future development.
