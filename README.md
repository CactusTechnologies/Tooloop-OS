# Tooloop OS

![](https://github.com/vollstock/Tooloop-OS/wiki/images/tooloop-header.jpg)

*Tooloop OS* is a minimal installation of [Debian Linux](https://www.debian.org/), customized to fit the needs of public multimedia installations.

*Tooloop OS* is for media artists. It is supposed to provide a platform that is stable and easy to maintain even for those with little experience. You focus on your art. Let *Tooloop OS* present it in the best possible way!


# Features

**Lightweight**  
*Tooloop OS* boots to your running application in seconds and all the power of your machine is used to display your application and for nothing else.  

- Very low memory footprint
- No unnecessary system services
- Only bare minimum of [installed packages](https://github.com/vollstock/Tooloop-OS/wiki/overview)


**Stable**  
Debian Linux is known for its stability and it’s used all over the world as a power workhorse. It’s the solid foundation that you can trust. [Others](http://store.steampowered.com/steamos/) [do](http://www.ubuntu.com), too.


**Easy to manage**  
There's certain management tasks we repeatedly have to do with our live systems. Managing assets or configuring machines and software. *Tooloop OS* provides some features so you can always reach out to your machines over the network that will make your life easier.

- Remote management using SSH
- Confidence monitoring using VNC
- Network folder to manage assets
- Plan to add [configuration utilities](https://github.com/vollstock/Tooloop-OS/wiki/configuration-utilities) to manage Tooloop Boxes from your browser.

**Distraction free**  
*Tooloop OS* is there for you to ensure your audience will only get to see your application. Nothing will stop the show or present anything that shouldn’t be there.

# Who should use it?

*Tooloop OS* is designed for any kind of public, live system such as museum installations, digital signage, kiosks, etc.

Being a Debian Linux, *Tooloop OS* can run pretty much any Linux software. However I do specifically target and test these frameworks:

- [openframeworks](http://openframeworks.cc/)
- [Processing](https://processing.org)
- [Gstreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/)
- [Kivy](https://kivy.org/)


# Status

*The project is in a very early, pre-release state. Nothing here is usable and I strongly advise you not to use it in a live setup at the moment!*

The goal is to provide ISOs ready for you to install. In this early stage however, I'm still researching and defining all components and how the overall system should work. What features I would want from it and could use in the future.

Please check the [roadmap](https://github.com/vollstock/Tooloop-OS/wiki/roadmap) for future development.


# Installation

If you're brave or curious, and want to check it out, please follow the [manual steps](https://github.com/vollstock/Tooloop-OS/wiki/Manual-installation).  

Even installing manually, you can get your *Tooloop Box* up and running in about 30 minutes (if you're quick in the terminal ;-)).
